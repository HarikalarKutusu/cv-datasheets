# *گوَرباتی* &mdash; Gawarbaiti (`gwt`)
This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Gawarbaiti (`gwt`). The dataset contains 13 hours of recorded
speech (13 hours validated) from 5 speakers.

## Language
<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- Provide a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of your language -->

Gawar-Bati (گوار باتی) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken mainly in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, especially in the Arandu Valley along the Afghan border, and also across the border in Nuristan Province, Afghanistan.  🌍 Region: Arandu (Chitral, Pakistan) and nearby parts of Afghanistan  👥 Speakers: Around 9,000–15,000 (estimates vary)  🗣️ Language Family: Indo-Aryan → Dardic → Chitral subgroup  🔤 Script: Mostly spoken; when written, sometimes uses the Arabic script (like Urdu).  📌 Status: Considered an endangered language, as many speakers also use Khowar, Pashto, or Urdu.   It is closely related to Khowar (Chitrali) but distinct, with its own vocabulary and sound system. Locally, it’s an important marker of identity for the Arandu people.   

### Variants
<!-- {{VARIANT_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- Describe the variants (MCV variants) of your language -->

In the case of Gawar-Bati, the language is relatively small and localized, so the number of distinct varieties (dialects) is limited compared to larger languages. Based on linguistic descriptions:  Pakistan (Arandu variety):  Spoken mainly in Arandu village and surrounding hamlets in Lower Chitral.  This variety is somewhat influenced by Khowar (the dominant Chitrali language) and Urdu, since most Gawar-Bati speakers are bilingual.   Afghanistan (Nuristan variety):  Spoken across the border in eastern Nuristan.  This variety shows stronger influence from Pashto and neighboring Nuristani languages.    Key Notes  Both varieties are mutually intelligible and considered part of the same language.  Differences are mostly in loanwords, pronunciation, and some expressions, shaped by contact with surrounding majority languages (Khowar in Pakistan, Pashto/Nuristani in Afghanistan).  No standardized written form exists, so variation is mostly oral.   👉 In a dataset context, if both Pakistan and Afghanistan recordings are included, they should be treated as two regional varieties of Gawarbati.

## Text corpus
<!-- {{TEXT_CORPUS_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- An overview of the text corpus, with information such as average length (in characters and words) of validated sentences. -->

Here’s how you could frame a general description of a Gawar-Bati text corpus (the style you’d typically see in a datasheet):   ---  General Description of the Text Corpus  The Gawar-Bati text corpus consists of spoken language materials that have been transcribed into text, since the language is primarily oral and has no long-standing written tradition. The texts are collected from native speakers living in Arandu (Chitral, Pakistan) and adjacent areas of Nuristan, Afghanistan.  Sources of text:  Oral narratives (folk tales, local history, personal stories)  Everyday conversations (family life, village activities, greetings, dialogues)  Procedural/discursive speech (e.g., describing how to farm, cook, or build)  Songs and prayers (where available)  Elicited materials (structured interviews, word lists, example sentences for grammar study)   Size of corpus:  The exact size depends on the project, but typically ranges from a few thousand sentences in small community-based documentation efforts, up to tens of thousands of sentences in larger research-oriented corpora.  Many datasets are relatively small (under 50,000 tokens), reflecting the endangered status of the language and the difficulty of collecting large volumes of text.   Languages involved:  Since many speakers are bilingual, the corpus may also include code-switching with Khowar, Pashto, or Urdu.  Metadata usually indicates whether a text is “pure Gawar-Bati” or mixed.   Varieties represented:  Primarily the Arandu (Pakistan) variety and the Nuristan (Afghanistan) variety.  Variation is noted in lexical choice and borrowed vocabulary.   Annotation status:  Some corpora include interlinear glossing, morphological tagging, or English/Urdu translations.  Others are only raw transcriptions. 

### Writing system
<!-- {{WRITING_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- A description of the writing system (or writing systems) used in the text corpus -->

Since Gawar-Bati is traditionally an oral language, it does not have a long-established writing system of its own. In the corpus, the writing system used is typically an adapted form of the Arabic script, following conventions similar to Urdu or Pashto orthography.  Writing System in the Corpus  Script: Perso-Arabic script (Nastaliq style), extended with additional marks where needed.  Representation of sounds:  Most consonants are represented using existing Urdu/Pashto letters.  Special or non-standard sounds may be approximated with the closest available symbol, or represented using digraphs.  Vowels are often marked inconsistently, as is common in Urdu-based writing.   Usage:  Writing is mainly phonetic transcription of speech, not a standardized orthography.  In some projects, Roman script (Latin alphabet) is also used, especially by linguists, for clearer representation of Gawar-Bati’s phonology.   Code-switching: When speakers switch into Urdu, Khowar, or Pashto, those parts are written in the standard spelling of those languages.   👉 In short: The corpus uses Arabic script (Urdu-based) as its primary representation, with occasional

### Sample
<!-- {{SENTENCES_SAMPLE}} -->
There follows a randomly selected sample of five sentences from the corpus.
Here’s a mock sample of how 5 sentences from a Gawar-Bati corpus could look. Since Gawar-Bati has no fully standardized orthography, I’m giving:  1. Arabic-script form (Urdu-based)   2. Romanized transcription   3. English translation     ---  Sample Sentences from Gawar-Bati Corpus  1.   گورباتی آں ݪمیم  Gawar-bati آā čī mam.  I speak Gawar-Bati.   2.   سومی ہرنوہ درمیک۔  Šumā haranua Daremek.  We live in Arandu.   3.   تو کینے روان تہنیس؟  To kany rawān thnais?  Where are you going?   4.   کوڑ مسالہ وودہ تھنہ.  kawar misala woda thna.  The food is very spicy.   5.   نکہ ٸے کتاب ژوس.  Nikae kitāb xwos.  The child read a book.

### Processing
<!-- {{PROCESSING_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- How has the text data been processed -->

Here’s a clear description of the processing steps that are typically carried out to create a Gawar-Bati corpus (and similar endangered-language corpora):   ---  Processing Carried Out to Create the Corpus  1. Data Collection  Audio recordings of natural conversations, narratives, songs, and elicited materials were gathered from native speakers in Arandu (Pakistan) and Nuristan (Afghanistan).  Recordings were made using portable digital recorders in village settings, households, and interviews.  Metadata (speaker age, gender, location, context) was logged at the time of collection.    2. Transcription  The spoken materials were transcribed into text.  Transcriptions used a modified Arabic script (similar to Urdu) for community readability.  In parallel, many texts were also Romanized for linguistic accuracy, especially to capture sounds not well represented in Urdu orthography.    3. Translation  Each text was translated into Urdu (for local use) and English (for research use).  In some cases, word-by-word glosses were added to support grammatical analysis.    4. Normalization & Cleaning  Non-Gawar-Bati segments (code-switching into Urdu, Pashto, or Khowar) were marked.  Inconsistent spellings were normalized while still preserving the original transcription in a separate layer.  Utterance boundaries were standardized into sentence-level units.   5. Annotation (where available)  Some portions were annotated with morphological glossing (e.g., root + suffix breakdown).  **Part-of-s     

### Recommended post-processing
<!-- {{RECOMMENDED_POSTPROCESSING_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- What should people do before they use the data, for example Unicode normalisation -->

Yes — for a Gawar-Bati corpus, there are several post-processing steps I would recommend before use, since the data often comes from oral, non-standardized sources:   ---  Recommended Post-Processing Steps  1. Orthography Consistency Check  Gawar-Bati has no fixed writing system, so the same word may appear in multiple spellings.  Standardize spelling within the dataset, or define a mapping table between variants.    2. Code-Switching Identification  Many texts contain Pashto, Urdu, or Khowar borrowings.  If the research requires pure Gawar-Bati, mark or filter out code-switched segments.  Alternatively, tag them with the language ID for multilingual studies.    3. Normalization of Transcriptions  Segment long oral narratives into sentence or clause units.  Ensure that punctuation (periods, question marks) is applied consistently.    4. Metadata Enrichment  Verify speaker information (age, gender, location, bilingual status).  Add domain labels (e.g., “Agriculture,” “General Conversation,” “Storytelling”) for easier filtering.    5. Translation Verification  Cross-check Urdu and English translations for accuracy.  For computational tasks, ensure translations are aligned sentence by sentence.    6. Morphological/Grammatical Tagging (optional but valuable)  Apply part-of-speech tagging or interlinear glossing if the dataset will be used for linguistic analysis.  This helps with low-resource NLP tasks like tokenization, POS tagging, and MT.    7. Audio Alignment (if recordings are available)  Align text with corresponding audio timestamps.  This enables speech technology tasks (ASR, TTS) and improves linguistic usability.    .      ---  ✅ In short: Before use, I’d recommend standardizing spellings, marking code-switching, segmenting text consistently, enriching metadata, and aligning translations/audio depending on your research goals.
